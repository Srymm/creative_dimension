# Description

**Creative Dimension** is a **Minecraft datapack** that add an **independant flat creative dimension** to your world.

This dimension is only composed of **one layer** of grass block at coordinate **Y = 0**. 
There is no **structures**, no **mobs**, no **rains**, no **day-night cycle** and a **constant ambient light**. 

In this dimension, each player has an **inventory**, an **enderchest inventory**, an **experience amount**, and a **gamemode** (default to creative) that is **distinct** from **the other basic dimensions** of the game.

<br />

# In-game commands

## Non-operator command
### `/trigger cd`

This command allows **any player** to **switch** between the **creative and other dimensions**.

Its sole purpose is to **provide access** to the cd:change_dimension function for **non-operator players**.
For more information, refer to the [description](#function-cdchange_dimension) of the *cd:change_dimension* function.

## Operator commands

> [!important]
> Please only use functions from the `cd` namespace. These are the functions **intended to be used by operators**.
> All functions in the `creative_dimension` namespace are internal and **must not be called directly**.

CD((cd)) --- INTERFACE(functions)
             INTERFACE --- A[change_dimension.mcfunction]
             INTERFACE --- B[load.mcfunction]
             INTERFACE --- C[set_default_position.mcfunction]
             INTERFACE --- D[unload.mcfunction]
```


<br />

### `/function cd:change_dimension`

This command allows **any player** to **switch** between the **creative and other dimensions**.

When the function is called **by a player**, a **marker is summoned** in their current dimension at the chunk (0, 0). This marker **stores information** about the **player's main inventory, ender chest inventory, game mode, experience, and position**. Then, the player **retrieves data from their previous marker** and is therefore **teleported to the other dimension**.

If players switch dimensions **without using this function**, they will be resynchronized by retrieving data from their previous marker information, **without being teleported**. However, because no marker is created in their current dimension during the transition, the **next time** they switch dimensions **using the datapack**, the teleportation will use a **default position** instead of a saved location. For more information about how default positions work, refer to the [description](#function-cdset_default_position) of the cd:set_default_position function.

**New players** are assigned a default marker in the **creative dimension when they first join**, with **empty** inventories, **creative** gamemode, and **no experience** at their first connection.

<br />

### `/function cd:load`

This function **loads the datapack** and is **called automatically** by the game when the datapack is added or when the command `/reload` is used.

When the data pack is loaded, the **chunk at (0, 0)** is set to **always be loaded** in **each dimension**, an **armor stand** is summoned in the creative dimension and **two scoreboard objectives** are added.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using other datapacks that define **additional dimensions**, make sure to **force-load the chunk at (0, 0) in each of those dimensions** manually using `/execute in <dimension> run forceload add 0 0`.
> This is required for the datapack to function properly.

<br />

### `/function cd:set_default_position`

This function updates the **default teleportation position** based on the player's **current location and dimension**.

There are two default positions used by the datapack :
- The **creative default position**, initially set to coordinates (0, 0, 0)
- The **overworld  default position**, automatically initialized at the position of the first player processed by the datapack

These positions are useful when a player switches dimensions **outside the datapack system**, as the default position will be used for teleportation during their **next switch**.

<br />

### `/function cd:unload`

This function **unloads the datapack** and should be called **before uninstalling** it.

When the datapack is unloaded, all **chunks loaded, entities summoned, and scoreboard objectives created by the datapack** are permanently removed.

> [!WARNING]
> This action is **irreversible**. All saved player states (inventory, experience, etc.) will be deleted.
> **To avoid data loss**, make sure that **no players are currently in the creative dimension** before running this command.
